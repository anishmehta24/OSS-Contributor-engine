"""Reviewer — the loop controller that turns the autonomous pilot into an
actual autonomous system.

Per iteration:
    1. Call Patch Writer (with prior failures fed in as context after
       attempt 1).
    2. If the patch produced edits → run Test Runner against the workspace.
    3. Inspect the outcome and decide: retry / accept / give_up.
    4. If retrying, reset the workspace to its post-clone state so the
       next attempt starts from clean.

Termination conditions:
    - Decision is `accept`  → return success.
    - Decision is `give_up` → return failure with reason.
    - Hit `max_attempts`    → return failure.
    - Two attempts in a row produce IDENTICAL diffs → return failure
      (LLM isn't learning; stop burning tokens).

Decision logic (deterministic — no extra LLM call here, intentional):

    patch.success = False
        → give_up (Patch Writer already gave up; e.g. zero edits returned)

    patch.success = True AND test.classification = "pass"
        → accept

    patch.success = True AND test.classification = "fail"
        → retry (clear signal: the patch broke syntax)

    patch.success = True AND test.classification = "needs_env"
        → accept-with-caveat: still success, since the patch itself didn't
          break anything we can detect. Mark with summary so downstream knows.

    patch.success = True AND test.classification in ("error", "no_project")
        → give_up (infra problem or unsupported language)
