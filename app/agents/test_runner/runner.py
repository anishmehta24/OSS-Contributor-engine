"""Test Runner orchestrator.

Today supports Python only. Two phases run sequentially inside the sandbox:

    Phase 1 — syntax_check
        `python -m py_compile <changed-files>` (or all .py files in the
        project sub-dir, capped, when no changed list is given). Pure
        syntax validation, no imports executed. Fast and deterministic;
        if this fails, the patch is broken and the Reviewer should retry.

    Phase 2 — collect_tests
        `pytest --collect-only -q`. Proves tests are at least discoverable.
        Often fails because the project's runtime imports need
        `pip install -e .`, which the sandbox doesn't do today — those
        failures classify as `needs_env` (not the patch's fault).

The runner returns a structured TestRunResult either way; it never raises
for sandbox-side problems (image missing, timeout) — those become
classification="error".
